I'm a software engineer focused on building delightful, accessible web experiences. I care about performance, thoughtful motion, and creating interfaces that feel alive without getting in your way.

Recently, I've been exploring design systems, component accessibility, and scalable frontend architectures.

I believe in crafting interfaces that are both **resilient** and **expressive**. My approach balances clear information hierarchy, subtle motion, and practical implementation details so that products remain understandable and maintainable over time.

Over the past few years, I have:

- Shipped and iterated on **component libraries** used across large product surfaces
- Led **accessibility** initiatives with clear success metrics and guidance
- Prototyped **micro-interactions** to communicate state changes and intent
- Coached teams on **performance budgets** and design system adoption

Beyond work, I enjoy documenting patterns, building small tools, and writing about design‑engineering tradeoffs. When exploring new ideas, I focus on constraints first, then gradually expand the vocabulary of components and interactions.
