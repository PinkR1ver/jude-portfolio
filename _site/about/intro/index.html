<p>I’m a software engineer focused on building delightful, accessible web experiences. I care about performance, thoughtful motion, and creating interfaces that feel alive without getting in your way.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been exploring design systems, component accessibility, and scalable frontend architectures.</p>

<p>I believe in crafting interfaces that are both <strong>resilient</strong> and <strong>expressive</strong>. My approach balances clear information hierarchy, subtle motion, and practical implementation details so that products remain understandable and maintainable over time.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped and iterated on <strong>component libraries</strong> used across large product surfaces</li>
  <li>Led <strong>accessibility</strong> initiatives with clear success metrics and guidance</li>
  <li>Prototyped <strong>micro-interactions</strong> to communicate state changes and intent</li>
  <li>Coached teams on <strong>performance budgets</strong> and design system adoption</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond work, I enjoy documenting patterns, building small tools, and writing about design‑engineering tradeoffs. When exploring new ideas, I focus on constraints first, then gradually expand the vocabulary of components and interactions.</p>
